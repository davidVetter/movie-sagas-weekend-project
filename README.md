# Featured Flix

## Description

_Duration: 17 Hours_

## Welcome to Featured Flix!

### We have a small but essential list of the movies you need to see!

The home pages is a full list of the movies in our database. The user may click any movie poster to be taken to a details page with more information about the movie. On each details page is an 'edit' button that will take the user to a new page with pre-filled inputs to change the title or description of the movie they had selected. Refreshing either the details page or edit page will keep the user and the information on the page. There is a nav bar at the top of each page which as a "Home" and "Add Movie" option the move to either page. The "Add Movie" will take the user to a page that has the inputs required to add a new movie to our database! The user simply enters the new movie title, url for the movie poster, a description for the movie and which genres the movie falls under. The application supports a variety of screen sizes from mobile to desktop!
